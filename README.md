Example that we did during class

1 - Make the variable mainPlayerWeapon a static 
    global variable
	
2 - Create a fuction called SetPlayerWeapon that 
    takes as a parameter a WeaponType
    it stores the value in mainPlayerWeapon
	
3 - Add 2 more weapon types, RocketLauncher and 
    MachineGun, make sure their name prints 
	correctly
